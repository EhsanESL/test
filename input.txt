00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.880Donato MasiSo yeah, and the purpose of this call is to map a little bit the business model of metal assembly. So understanding which way the digitalization interventions that we're putting in practice can support a bit more the.00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:35.610Donato MasiAnd let's say the business model as a whole apart from the manufacturing related operations. So we will touch nine different points. So customer segments, customer relationships, channels, revenue streams, activities, resources, partners, cost structure and value proposition. Then I explain one by one what they mean.00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:58.910Donato MasiAnd, well, I ask you questions so around 5-6 minutes per question so we can keep the meeting within one hour as planned. OK, so if we start from the customer segments so we mean the groups of people or companies that were trying to target and sell your product or service. So who are they and in which way they are segmented?00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:45.400Iain Collis (Guest)OK.00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.690Iain Collis (Guest)So we are trying to sell to tier one.00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:06.950Iain Collis (Guest)Automotive businesses00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.810Donato MasiUh-huh00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:18.540Iain Collis (Guest)uh and agrammatic businesses, so we're not. We're not trying to sell to major OEM's, but some of those tier one businesses will be OEMs in their own right.00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:11.250Donato MasiOK.00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.700Iain Collis (Guest)But responsible for.00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:37.400Iain Collis (Guest)One part of the vehicle, as opposed to the entire vehicle itself. So for example, someone like Knorr bremse. He's an OEM in the sense that it designs and supplies emission control systems.00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:44.640Iain Collis (Guest)And it, but it's not. It's not responsible for how those emission control systems are used within the vehicle.00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:46.640Iain Collis (Guest)Does that make sense?00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.030Donato MasiYes, it's less.00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:54.120Iain Collis (Guest)Yeah, and then you'll get. You'll get other tier ones like someone like Morelli or or. The bit of money that we deal with that.00:01:54.910 --> 00:02:03.470Iain Collis (Guest)Although it has an input into the design of the interior of the vehicle, it's really working to the customers requirements.00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.000Iain Collis (Guest)Just does that make sense?00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.660Donato MasiYes.00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:07.000Iain Collis (Guest)Yeah.00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.980Donato MasiHow many customers are we talking about?00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.670Iain Collis (Guest)How many miles does Metalassemblies have now? Uh, about 10.00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:13.310Donato MasiYep.00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.840Donato MasiThen OK and the.00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:23.530Donato MasiI mean in the UK, which percentage roughly does it represent of the whole market?00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.420Iain Collis (Guest)The customers we supply all the all. The total volume of this.00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:26.130Donato MasiYep.00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.540Donato MasiThe one that you supply, yeah.00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.030Iain Collis (Guest)I would say there's bits, probably 5%.00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:32.900Donato MasiOf the whole market.00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:33.200Iain Collis (Guest)Yep.00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.540Donato MasiOK, and there is there any way in which you would segments these customers? You'd cluster them into groups.00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:50.460Iain Collis (Guest)I'm yeah you. We would probably cluster them into people that supply things for the interior of the vehicle.00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.220Iain Collis (Guest)People that supply things for the powertrain of the vehicle.00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.210Iain Collis (Guest)People that supply things up for the.00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.260Iain Collis (Guest)Sort of exterior of the vehicle.00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.300Donato MasiBut fact, can you tell me in terms of volumes?00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:15.990Donato MasiUh, I will. This different segments, which is the importance of these different segments in terms of contribution to turn over.00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:23.420Iain Collis (Guest)Yeah, so for us the the things that go inside the vehicle and much more interesting because they tend to have more added value.00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:39.080Iain Collis (Guest)And so the powertrain stuff thought we can supply. It tends to have quite a low added value and the exterior is normally beyond our capacity, so it's the interior of the vehicle where we see the most.00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.750Donato MasiOK.00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.790Iain Collis (Guest)Opportunity for adding value.00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.450Donato MasiSo raffling percentage.00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.380Iain Collis (Guest)And in terms of the marketplace, is a whole.00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.400Donato MasiNow, in terms of your turnover.00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.220Iain Collis (Guest)OK, it's so so. The interior of the vehicle would represent about.00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:59.400Iain Collis (Guest)80%.00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:00.240Donato MasiOK.00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.750Iain Collis (Guest)Currently.00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.870Donato MasiPerfect.00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:15.820Donato MasiAnd now we can move to the second point. That regards the type of relationship that you have with this customers. So how would you define the relationship that you have is a kind of.00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:23.420Donato MasiThe, uh, highly integrated, transactional, uh, how would you define it?00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:46.420Iain Collis (Guest)I think it depends on the customer and so some of the customers. It's a transactional relationship, so dumb and, and that's because we probably aren't actively chasing work from that particular customer for all sorts of reasons. So where we do supply, say JLR directly? And it's a very much a transactional relationship? We're not trying to win new business directly off of JLR.00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:26.560Donato MasiOK.00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:31.200Donato MasiUh-huh00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:42.290Donato Masiuh-huh00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.670Donato Masiuh-huh00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.950Iain Collis (Guest)4.00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:58.870Iain Collis (Guest)Some of our customers so customers like Morelli and Drexel Wire. It's. It's an integrated relationship because of the the volume of business we've got for them.00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:05.310Iain Collis (Guest)And then for other customers safe for customers like Valeo, it's somewhere between the two.00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:24.520Donato Masiintegrated what does it mean? Uh, easy, easy to extend it, for instance, to Co designing the components having shared objectives shared a you know risk, shared risk and shared revenues to which level is it into? Our integrated with these suppliers?00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:31.890Iain Collis (Guest)Say, say, say it it's integrated on the on, on the on the automotive basis and what that means is it when it suits the customer.00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:44.090Iain Collis (Guest)It's it's integrated, and when it doesn't suit the customer, it isn't. So I'll give you a. I'll give you an example of that from a meeting earlier today. So we are. We were discussing our packaging.00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:40.710Donato MasiYep.00:05:44.750 --> 00:06:15.390Iain Collis (Guest)And how we will make sure that reusable packaging transfers backwards and forwards between us. So we we take the packaging. We agree with the customer that we will put 20 parts in a box and we will use a particular size box and we will use particular size pallet and we will only ever put 12 boxes on a pallet and that pallet will have a lid and the labels will look in a certain way and we we all agree that and sign up to it because it's important to us and then that you know we we don't damage the parts however they want to use.00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.490Donato MasiYep.00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:45.730Iain Collis (Guest)Reuse that packaging, not just the plastic boxes, but they also want to reuse the wooden pallet that it all sits on. So we say to the customer. OK, So what we want then is we want a packing specification that says this is how you will supply us back the packaging. Because if you don't supply the packaging back to us in the same manner, high if it's 20 boxes on a pallet. If you supply 30 bucks in their pocket, there won't be enough pallets in the system for us to supply your back. And the answer I got back was no, we can't do that.00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:33.430Donato MasiUh-huh00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:59.250Iain Collis (Guest)And so I said, well, why can't you do that? Or we couldn't get anyone in our business to sign for that? Oh no, no, that would be too much. So I I that that I think beautifully describes how the automotive industry works it at our level.00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:00.250Donato MasiOK.00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:13.690Iain Collis (Guest)And we at where we sit in the supply chain. So on the one level. In other words, information going into the customer. We're pretty integrated, but on the other level, when you know, it seems the customer we're not integrated at all because the customer just doesn't want to know them.00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:02.490Donato MasiYep.00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:06.440Donato MasiUh-huh00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:13.480Donato MasiYep.00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:19.870Iain Collis (Guest)But we will put people like Jackson Meyer. We will support them with design.00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:30.270Iain Collis (Guest)They're not metal specialist there passively, so they'll have us in meetings and say how would you do that? How can you do that? Can you help us here? But ultimately their design responsible we're only suggesting.00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:31.670Donato MasiOK.00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:35.030Iain Collis (Guest)If they, if they choose to take our suggestions, they still have to put their name to it.00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:36.930Donato MasiOK, clear.00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:46.990Donato MasiThank you yeah, so regarding the channels that you use to reach out your customers, both existing and new ones, what are they?00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:49.620Iain Collis (Guest)How do we find new customers?00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:49.870Donato MasiYep.00:07:51.460 --> 00:08:15.080Iain Collis (Guest)It's very much through word of mouth, so we we don't really advertise in any way. We have no marketing strategy per say because we're not looking to win lots of new customers because because of the nature of the relationship between supplier and customer in the automotive industry or business of our sides can only support so many customers.00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:02.630Donato MasiUh-huh00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:06.740Donato Masiuh-huh00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:16.280Donato MasiOK.00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:21.100Iain Collis (Guest)Because our indirect structure only enables us to support so many customers.00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:25.270Donato MasiOK, but this is. This is something yes, sorry, go ahead.00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:23.370Iain Collis (Guest)So.00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:33.060Iain Collis (Guest)So, So what? So what? We are what we tend to do is we, we, we? We sort of look at the, the the vehicles that we manufacturing four and understand when they finish.00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:37.650Iain Collis (Guest)And we look to either win that replacement business off of our existing customer.00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:38.370Donato MasiUh-huh00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:42.320Iain Collis (Guest)Or we look to work with whoever won that replacement business.00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:52.490Donato Masibut the fact is, these are how you want it to continue or for the future you would like to do some market intelligence and this type of things.00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:56.970Iain Collis (Guest)And I think that it can't continue that way for the future because.00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:04.100Iain Collis (Guest)Because of the state of the automotive history in the UK, there isn't the volume there anymore, so.00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:01.440Donato MasiYep.00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:05.330Iain Collis (Guest)The.00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:17.220Iain Collis (Guest)Automotive supply yeah we are just at automotive supplier. It's very difficult for us to supply into, although we do supply into Europe and the rest of the world, we only do that as a result of.00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:20.330Iain Collis (Guest)Did tier ones that we supply.00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:27.890Iain Collis (Guest)Making us do that if we try to just do it in our own right, it would be very, very difficult to do so. We can really only fish.00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:30.140Iain Collis (Guest)In the UK pond.00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:40.490Iain Collis (Guest)And the UK pond is getting smaller and smaller because the number of vehicles that are built in the UK are getting smaller and smaller. The other issue is that, uh.00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:51.840Iain Collis (Guest)From what I can see, the electric vehicle market is going to fragment the market more and more, so whereas Matt maybe now you have some you know.00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:02.540Donato MasiUh-huh00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:20.720Iain Collis (Guest)You know, actually we're going to build electric vehicles, but we're going to build them in a different way and lower volumes. Or we're going to go after one particular marketplace. So you get companies like arrival coming on the scene and wanting to bar wanting to build 2000 buses a year, and they're gonna do that in modular factories. And and you know, so.00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:33.640Iain Collis (Guest)The old business model no longer works because instead of having one big company to go to, suddenly you get lots of smaller companies that want a different type of structure and a different type of.00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:35.710Iain Collis (Guest)Parts applied to them.00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:48.490Donato MasiPerfect and the aware of any, let's say channel to reach out customers that is particularly used in the industry or that you are thinking to use in future.00:10:48.740 --> 00:11:06.470Iain Collis (Guest)So the way that we do that at the moment is through the the various trade associations that we belong to. So through the SMT or through make UK, and so that's how we we kind of work out, who these new vehicle manufacturers are and those new vehicle makes a two way things are weird, sort of asking the SMT who's.00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:57.240Donato MasiUh-huh00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:15.210Iain Collis (Guest)Who's going to do this and this this the customers are also asking the SMT. Who are the suppliers that can support us?00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:22.520Donato MasiOK, and uh, is this, uh, able to do the same job internationally, or only in the UK?00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.850Iain Collis (Guest)I think that's only going to do the job in the UK.00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:29.820Donato MasiOK, any idea for the international market?00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:47.140Iain Collis (Guest)Yeah, only as we are now where we would support where you get a vehicle that is built globally. So for example in this town cash guy is a global vehicle. If we win the business in the UK then by default we win the business in in in the global marketplace, yeah?00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:38.530Donato MasiUh-huh00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:41.060Donato MasiYep.00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:57.390Donato MasiInternationally OK, but to capture demand apart from the one that is UK related, do you think you you will put any mechanism in place or the intended?00:11:56.510 --> 00:11:57.130Iain Collis (Guest)I.00:11:57.210 --> 00:12:09.810Iain Collis (Guest)I don't think it's a business we would be able to support a significant a significant amount of standalone international business. We don't have it, you know we don't have a a footprint that will allow us to do that. It's it's already extraordinarily difficult to supply.00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:17.100Iain Collis (Guest)You know, in the way that we do at the moment just because of the cost of when things go wrong.00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:18.840Donato MasiOK, what do you mean?00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:36.760Iain Collis (Guest)OK, so again, if I use so at the moment we we supply a part for BMW who via Valley 04 BMW three and four series. So the BMW three and four series is built in Mexico in China and in Germany.00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:26.610Donato MasiYep.00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:38.180Donato MasiYep.00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:42.630Iain Collis (Guest)So, so we only one that business because of our links to UK value.00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:53.580Iain Collis (Guest)Uh, and although we don't supply that part in the UK at all, we are having to support it in all three of those locations so but we don't have a. We don't have any.00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:57.440Iain Collis (Guest)The UM, any employees in any of those locations.00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:05.790Iain Collis (Guest)So if something goes wrong, we're completely reliant on agencies to support us, and that's very expensive.00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:08.570Donato MasiOK, I understand.00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:31.650Donato MasiAnd OK, I think this is enough regarding channels. Now let's talk a bit about activity. I mean, uh, we should talk about revenue streams, but I assume that all the revenues are transaction based so you don't charge customers with a fee for a specific service, correct? So you don't have a recurring revenues for a specific service.00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:38.190Iain Collis (Guest)No, we we yeah, we said we would we we have two revenue streams, three revenue streams. We have a revenue stream from tooling.00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:36.730Donato MasiOK.00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:39.010Donato MasiOK.00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:55.370Iain Collis (Guest)So we win in order to produce a tool to produce parts, we have a revenue stream from pre production parts. So we we run the program but the tooling is introduced yet but the customer wants or support in manufacturing production parts and then we have the revenue stream from the serial production parts.00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:46.580Donato MasiUh-huh00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:56.990Donato Masiuh OK.00:13:56.470 --> 00:14:04.020Iain Collis (Guest)So yeah, there's no revenue stream for charging customers for our intellectual property or our ability to help them design something.00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:06.110Donato MasiOK, so it's all production.00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:06.580Iain Collis (Guest)Yep.00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:07.820Donato MasiCorrect, perfect.00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:22.920Donato MasiSo let's, uh, make an overview of the key resources that you have to deliver these products. So in terms of the human resources, how many employees are there now in metalassemblies?00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:25.520Iain Collis (Guest)Well, how about 120?00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:33.210Donato MasiOK, so how many of them are there? Can you split them between line manager, separators? Engineers? How are they organized?00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:41.210Iain Collis (Guest)OK, I could do that, but it's off the top of my head so I think operator wise. Yeah, roughly roughly. There's probably around about 60 operators.00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:38.320Donato MasiAnd lastly, we don't have to be precise.00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:41.910Donato MasiOK.00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:44.570Iain Collis (Guest)Uh, and then if we said, UM.00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:56.140Iain Collis (Guest)Indirect staff to support directly support those operators, so we're talking now. Forklift truck drivers. Machine setters that type of thing. I would say another 20 people.00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:50.130Donato MasiUh-huh00:14:56.370 --> 00:14:56.740Donato MasiOK.00:14:57.140 --> 00:15:11.500Iain Collis (Guest)And then if you then talk about indirect staff to support the operation of the factory. So now I'm thinking quality people, you know quality technicians, engineer toolmakers, that sort of thing that I would say that's probably another 30.00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:12.580Donato MasiOK.00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:14.510Iain Collis (Guest)Yeah, so that goes to 110 I think.00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:15.440Donato MasiYep.00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:20.040Iain Collis (Guest)And then the other twenty people are going to be people like me, the accounts department.00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:23.220Iain Collis (Guest)A new product reduction that everything.00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:26.280Donato MasiOK, so which type of visa?00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:39.140Donato MasiWhich which of these human resources are a, let's say, strategic for you? Very, very easy to replace or critical for the processes. Sorry, very difficult to replace or critical for the processes.00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:41.250Iain Collis (Guest)Right now, everything.00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:40.890Donato MasiYep.00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.400Iain Collis (Guest)It's it's very difficult to replace anything but.00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:46.710Iain Collis (Guest)Yeah.00:15:50.220 --> 00:16:11.930Iain Collis (Guest)I'm trying to see whichever way we look at. I mean the the problem is it because of the way the automotive industry or any manufacturing district you know industries developed and the operators are fantastically important because they're the ones that get to touch every single part. So whereas perhaps you know 20 or 30 years ago, it was bums on seats and it can't be like that anymore because.00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:23.040Iain Collis (Guest)The consequences of getting something wrong and so punitive because you know the every every customer will have probably a minimum of £500 charge for one bad part.00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:22.450Donato MasiUh-huh00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:25.840Iain Collis (Guest)And say so so.00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:24.340Donato Masiuh-huh00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:38.470Iain Collis (Guest)Even even at operator level, it's difficult and strategic. Did you get to get the right person in there but but if you had to then put a scale on it.00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:35.490Donato MasiI understand.00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:44.190Iain Collis (Guest)And the most difficult people and our technicians.00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:39.390Donato MasiYep.00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:45.390Donato MasiOK.00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:54.290Iain Collis (Guest)So that will be whether that be toolmakers or robot technicians, or you know, or electrical engineers. Those are the most difficult people to to replace.00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:58.590Donato MasiHow long does it take to train a technician and how long to train operator?00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:13.340Iain Collis (Guest)And to properly train an operator if if it's if it's an operator for one process. So you you say to the operator, this is the only process we want you to do, then that would probably take around about 16 weeks to train them properly.00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:02.300Donato MasiUh-huh00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:09.970Donato Masiuh-huh00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:12.730Donato MasiOK.00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:20.850Iain Collis (Guest)If it was operator that we wanted to put across multiple processes, then that would probably take 18 months.00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:24.070Iain Collis (Guest)Before they were competent in all those processes.00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:24.710Donato MasiWow.00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:28.040Donato MasiSo I understand why it's so difficult for them to.00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:28.360Iain Collis (Guest)Yeah yeah, yeah.00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:41.850Iain Collis (Guest)Uh, where do we do a good job of that is a is a is a whole other conversation, but if if we were honest with ourselves, that's the sort of timescales that you were looking you. You'd be looking at for a a multi skilled competent operator across all the processes that we do.00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:52.160Donato MasiPerfect clear what about intellectual resources? Do you have any patent IP or copyright and what you do?00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:52.750Iain Collis (Guest)Don't.00:17:53.370 --> 00:18:04.800Donato MasiNo, OK, so we go down to the physical resources in terms of equipment inventory and buildings. So I there are now 3/4 buildings correct?00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:06.280Iain Collis (Guest)Yes.00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:12.330Donato MasiAnd the how many uh machinery Sardar in these four buildings?00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:17.430Iain Collis (Guest)70 odd yeah. How about about 70? Yeah, about 70, I'd say.00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:15.880Donato MasiJust so again, we don't have to be precise.00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:19.960Donato MasiYep, 70 machines OK. Do you have any?00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:25.520Donato MasiIn a just a a figure for the overall value of the machines.00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:32.150Iain Collis (Guest)I mean, if you're talking replacement value, then probably somewhere in the region of 6 million.00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:28.980Donato MasiYep.00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:33.530Donato MasiOK.00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:38.370Donato MasiAnd I wish this split between the different types of machine.00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:40.790Iain Collis (Guest)Uhm?00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:53.350Iain Collis (Guest)So pressing machines would be the most, so you know somewhere I would. I'm just guessing now, but somewhere in the region of about four million and then the sort of machines machines.00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:45.210Donato MasiYeah.00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:50.240Donato MasiOK.00:18:53.950 --> 00:19:03.340Iain Collis (Guest)I'm probably actually. I think he baby. I'm probably wildly underestimating it if we're talking replacement value, it's probably closer to 10 million. So if you say pressing machines is probably right about the 6 million mark.00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:00.780Donato MasiOK.00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:11.520Iain Collis (Guest)Uh, CNC machines is probably about about the 2,000,000 mark and then welding and all the rest of it would be another 2,000,000.00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:13.260Donato MasiPerfect.00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:36.100Donato MasiSo, uh, now we go down to what are the key partnership that you can have in terms of strategic alliances, corporations, joint ventures or strategic buyer supplier relationships? So let's start from the supply. Yes, OK. Is there any relationship with the suppliers that you consider strategic?00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:42.840Iain Collis (Guest)Yes, but it it's normally time based.00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:50.140Iain Collis (Guest)So it it it because it relates to a particular vehicle in a particular vehicle, gets built for a particular period of time.00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:43.890Donato MasiOK.00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:57.570Iain Collis (Guest)There are some exceptions to that, but perhaps over time they become less strategic. So for example, logistics partner.00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:51.130Donato MasiYep.00:19:58.090 --> 00:19:58.520Donato MasiUh-huh00:19:58.810 --> 00:20:18.240Iain Collis (Guest)Yeah, it's somebody we've been with for nearly 20 years, so we would consider that scitegic, but what's happened over the last two years is many of our customers have gone to an ex works situation, so it becomes less strategic. Not because we've necessarily got a problem with with the supplier, but simply because of the way that we deliver our goods has has changed.00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:19.120Iain Collis (Guest)And.00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:21.850Iain Collis (Guest)We would, we would say the same thing for.00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:25.660Iain Collis (Guest)Or the finishes that we use the painters and platers that we use.00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:26.690Donato MasiUh-huh00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:27.380Iain Collis (Guest)But00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:28.360Iain Collis (Guest)to.00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:35.630Iain Collis (Guest)They're they're only strategic because we've got a good working relationship with them.00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:38.830Iain Collis (Guest)But if one of them was to disappear tomorrow.00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:46.450Iain Collis (Guest)They wouldn't necessarily be a long term impact in in replacing them with somebody else.00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:49.500Iain Collis (Guest)Because there are plenty of supplies like that around.00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:47.830Donato MasiOK.00:20:50.190 --> 00:21:02.640Iain Collis (Guest)There are some suppliers or couple of supplies that we used to import things from China that would be strategic, because if they were no longer global supporters, there would be significant.00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:11.880Iain Collis (Guest)And cost issues, but they would only be strategic for a particular set of parts rather than the business as a whole.00:21:05.250 --> 00:21:05.680Donato MasiUh-huh00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:12.900Donato Masiuh-huh00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:14.380Iain Collis (Guest)And.00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:14.570Donato Masiperfect.00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:21.150Iain Collis (Guest)Yeah, but we would consider you know people like Aston University to be a strategic supplier.00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:21.940Donato MasiYep.00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:28.670Iain Collis (Guest)And for the business, and, you know, we would consider someone like the SMT to be strategic or make UK to be strategic.00:21:29.290 --> 00:21:31.600Iain Collis (Guest)And whether we'd call them a supplier or not.00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:36.560Donato MasiYeah, it would seem more, you know, a kind of collaborators.00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:33.360Iain Collis (Guest)Yeah.00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:37.810Iain Collis (Guest)Yeah yeah, yeah.00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:41.490Donato MasiCollaborators or partners business because you know they're not properly suppliers and.00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:39.580Iain Collis (Guest)Yeah.00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:54.070Donato MasiYes OK so made Aston and uh, OK, quite clear picture and do you have any joint venture with some partners, some type of agreements like this?00:21:54.410 --> 00:21:54.750Iain Collis (Guest)No.00:21:55.360 --> 00:22:12.200Donato MasiNot joint ventures. OK so clear also this point. Now regarding the cost structure, can you tell me roughly which is the cost structure within the business? So much is raw material, so much is a labor and.00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:32.410Iain Collis (Guest)Yep, so if we we define raw material as the steel that we put in parts the any bought out item that we put into apart and any subcontract process that is carried out on apart. So on average at the moment around about 61%.00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:13.880Donato MasiYep.00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:26.730Donato MasiUh-huh00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:42.220Iain Collis (Guest)Of our selling price is made up by those three elements material. Sorry labor then comes in at around about 11%.00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:38.080Donato MasiOK.00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:42.940Donato MasiYep.00:22:43.190 --> 00:23:01.690Iain Collis (Guest)So sort of 7273% of what we do. And then finally the distichs costs. He's around about 2 1/2%, so we kind of at 75% then of everything we do is come is taken up with those three things that that. That the.00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:54.540Donato MasiOK.00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:07.050Iain Collis (Guest)That's changed very succinct, significantly over the last 18 months, so that's as it is now.00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:18.550Iain Collis (Guest)Now, uh, but if we were having this conversation 18 months ago, then that would be closer to 60% and the reason for the change is material price increases.00:23:08.010 --> 00:23:08.420Donato MasiUh-huh00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:19.650Donato MasiOK.00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:34.620Iain Collis (Guest)So if we said just because it's an easy number to do, but if we if we said 12 months ago, 18 months ago that material was 50%. So for every pound we spent £0.50 of it was material material prices doubled.00:23:35.890 --> 00:23:36.400Donato MasiOK.00:23:36.070 --> 00:24:05.340Iain Collis (Guest)So, but but our selling price hasn't doubled because we are only able to add on the additional cost of the material, and it's very difficult to get an additional margin attacks to that. So now our selling price might be, you know, if it was 50 people or so pounds selling price and it was 50 people for now. The material costs is is a pound, but the selling price is only £1.50. So now the the the margin the material 'cause now it's 75% as opposed to the previous 50%.00:24:06.290 --> 00:24:17.430Iain Collis (Guest)And margins reduced to 25% in. Spent £15 in pounds. It's the same. The margin is the same number, but the the percentage wise has been totally skewed because of the big increases in material.00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:18.970Donato MasiClear.00:24:19.930 --> 00:24:21.130Iain Collis (Guest)What that means is that.00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:20.640Donato MasiOK.00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:26.390Iain Collis (Guest)Uh, because our pricing structure has to cope with.00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:28.430Iain Collis (Guest)A very long.00:24:30.210 --> 00:24:33.680Iain Collis (Guest)Lifetime so you know most vehicles we're quoting six year lifetime.00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:49.810Iain Collis (Guest)And it's very difficult for us to go back to the customer and say, oh, hang on a minute because of the change in material pricing. We need to reevaluate everything and come up with a new price. We can do it on new part on new work, but it's very difficult to do it on existing work.00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:59.070Donato MasiMickey, what do you think could be a solution for the volatility of the prices of raw materials? Because it's a problem that regards the whole industry.00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:03.420Iain Collis (Guest)Well, I think that that's that's the $64,000 question.00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:08.880Iain Collis (Guest)The the I mean the difficulty is is that for the last 10 years?00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:11.400Iain Collis (Guest)Material hasn't been volatile.00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:19.530Iain Collis (Guest)Uh, if you take out what happened in 2007, eight, which is actually now at 12 years 13 years ago.00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:12.200Donato MasiYeah.00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:25.390Iain Collis (Guest)And you can pretty much draw a line of plus or minus 10%.00:25:26.010 --> 00:25:36.890Iain Collis (Guest)Uh, of material pricing so it hasn't really been an issue. There have been the odd little spike here and there, but nothing nothing, you, you. It lasts for three months and you're you're through it and off you go.00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:38.330Iain Collis (Guest)And.00:25:39.130 --> 00:26:09.170Iain Collis (Guest)What's happened now is is a is a shock. It's a seismic shock. It's a step change in the marketplace and it shows no sign of of falling back. So when it when we first saw it happen they were saying well, it'll only last for six months because that's the sort of you know. Historically, that's what would have happened, and then it became well it. It'll start to drop back in in the beginning of 2021 and now everyone saying, well, maybe we'll see some changes in 2023, but we're probably going to see another increase in 2022 because of the gas.00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:48.080Donato MasiUh-huh00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:16.350Iain Collis (Guest)Well, energy pricing, yeah, so does the whole game has changed in terms of material?00:26:09.850 --> 00:26:10.770Donato MasiYep, prizes.00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:15.400Donato MasiYep.00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:23.930Iain Collis (Guest)And and that's a massive problem for anybody that manufacturers anything, because no one really knows how to pass it on to their customer.00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:28.310Donato MasiDo you think that, uh, a solution could be?00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:46.250Donato MasiThe the having a closed loop supply chain so control over closed loop flows of material in the sense that products are collected at the end of their life cycle and all the materials are reprocessed. Is it feasible or technical? It's too challenging.00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:50.920Iain Collis (Guest)Umm, well, I think for steel it's already feasible 'cause it already happens.00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:51.810Donato MasiUh-huh00:26:51.900 --> 00:27:00.560Iain Collis (Guest)But but the the the issue with steel is that you can only put so much of it back into the into the new production.00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:01.220Donato MasiYep.00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:08.360Donato MasiUh-huh00:27:08.410 --> 00:27:31.920Iain Collis (Guest)Is a challenge same for plastic? You know you you can only recycle plastic so many times and you know before it becomes unusably 'cause it brittles or whatever, whatever, whatever, but. But so I think there's a role for to play in that, but I think what what we're seeing with with companies like JLR, is that what they try and do is they take the responsibility of purchasing away from the supplier.00:27:18.030 --> 00:27:18.340Donato MasiYep.00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:32.830Donato MasiM.00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:39.870Iain Collis (Guest)So they go to a, you know, to A to a steel producer and say we are GLR and we want to buy X 100,000 tons a year.00:27:40.530 --> 00:27:55.300Iain Collis (Guest)And then they go to their suppliers and say you will buy from this person here and you know we'll sort out the price and that's the price that will charge you for the whole project. And then any price movement is taken care of between J Lara and the steel supplier.00:27:55.460 --> 00:27:55.950Donato MasiOK.00:27:56.250 --> 00:28:14.470Iain Collis (Guest)So that's that. And that's not a new thing. 'cause that's been going on for quite some time. The challenge for JLR is how do they get their tier ones to buy into it? So if you're oppressed worker supplying GLR directly, GLR can deal with it. But if you're a tier one, that maybe only has.00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:23.110Iain Collis (Guest)Uh, you know 4 metal parts that you buy it. It's very difficult for JLR to get the tier one to buy into that.00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:18.550Donato MasiUh-huh00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:34.290Iain Collis (Guest)Because the tier one sees that as part of his value chain and and you know why would he want to fix if steel is 50% of the prize, why would he want they want to fix 50% of the price?00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:27.360Donato MasiYep.00:28:34.550 --> 00:28:34.880Donato MasiYep.00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:36.430Donato MasiClear.00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:40.620Iain Collis (Guest)That yeah, that that is. That is the old way of looking at it.00:28:41.230 --> 00:28:46.590Iain Collis (Guest)The new way of looking at it is everyone going bloody hell. Look at the price of material we need to fix it. How do we fix it with the customer?00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:57.930Iain Collis (Guest)So yeah, there's a. There's a change afoot there. More and more tier ones are looking to try and fix every part of their material price with their customer and take it out of their value chain.00:28:58.890 --> 00:28:59.370Donato MasiOK.00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:07.930Donato MasiClear, so some more figures from the balance sheet, which was the be the limit of the last year.00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:15.500Iain Collis (Guest)I I I office of my head I don't know I I need to check it. Oh God he bit dark probably about 500,000.00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:12.050Donato MasiRoughly.00:29:16.170 --> 00:29:22.710Donato MasiAnd we, we, uh, which percentage is it of the turnover I've been? Or what's the current? What was the turnover?00:29:21.310 --> 00:29:24.540Iain Collis (Guest)So it was turned over, would be about 8 and a half million.00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:26.410Donato MasiOK, great.00:29:27.650 --> 00:29:29.840Iain Collis (Guest)Bear in mind you're asking me about last year, which was COVID.00:29:27.930 --> 00:29:28.360Donato MasiUh.00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:36.650Iain Collis (Guest)I mean normally I are EBIT da da, sort of nine million turnover would be about 700 and 5800 thousand.00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:47.530Donato MasiSo because of car with the let's say it went down to 6.5% normally around 890% something like that, yeah?00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:44.460Iain Collis (Guest)Yeah.00:29:46.570 --> 00:29:47.410Iain Collis (Guest)Yeah, yeah.00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:49.390Donato MasiPerfect.00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:58.570Donato MasiSo, uh, last thing that we have to discuss, that is, if you want to, the core of the business model is the value proposition. So in the sense of.00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:05.510Donato MasiThe what do you think that you are offering that is unique with respect to your competitors?00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:07.800Iain Collis (Guest)Then00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:10.030Iain Collis (Guest)it's a really difficult question, UM?00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:25.450Donato MasiSo just to make some examples, we could be either thinking of that you are fairly particularly low price or as quick service rather than a unique customer experience or unique design, or a combination of these aspects.00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:12.120Iain Collis (Guest)Yeah.00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:47.790Iain Collis (Guest)I so I so I think for metalassemblies the the breadth of processes that we can offer is different. You know when you consider the size of the business, it's it's different to other metal processors of our size because we we, you know we can offer turn parts, we can machine things we you know. So we've got a a different range of processes.00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:33.480Donato MasiUmm?00:30:34.270 --> 00:30:34.870Donato MasiOK.00:30:36.590 --> 00:30:36.890Donato MasiYep.00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:42.240Donato MasiYeah.00:30:48.270 --> 00:31:04.690Iain Collis (Guest)And and because we've got a different range of processes, we've got a larger range of technical expertise across those processes. And So what that means is that we we can normally cope with slightly more complex things.00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:48.620Donato MasiYeah.00:30:57.230 --> 00:30:57.800Donato MasiM.00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:06.090Iain Collis (Guest)4.00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:11.000Iain Collis (Guest)A baseball off that you would expect to business of our size to be able to cope with.00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:22.780Donato MasiK So if you wanna facture camps with the component that is a bit difficult to manufacture with a particular addition you say OK we can deal with it while other.00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:25.180Iain Collis (Guest)Yeah, so I think if you if if we were to take some.00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:36.300Iain Collis (Guest)That you sort of conventional way of doing it, which is to sort of put put rings on a piece of paper and look by the overlapped. So if you looked at a company like metal assemblies and let's just say our turnover is 10 million.00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:37.760Donato MasiM.00:31:37.270 --> 00:31:49.500Iain Collis (Guest)And and then you you, you looked at a business like ricor with a turnover of 100,000,000. And then you looked at a business like, UM Cirtek where the turnover of 250 million.00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:52.600Iain Collis (Guest)In a conventional supply chain.00:31:54.650 --> 00:32:23.140Iain Collis (Guest)It would be unusual for metalassemblies to be able to compete with either of those two companies at any point in their, you know, in their capacity just simply because of the economies of scale. But what we found with Metalassemblies is that we actually can compete at the fringes of their capacity and the fringes of their capacity. UM, are the sort of extremes of our capacity, but if we can compete in those areas, that's where we see the most adding value.00:31:59.490 --> 00:32:00.000Donato MasiUh-huh00:32:04.430 --> 00:32:05.240Donato Masimm-hmm00:32:13.610 --> 00:32:14.160Donato MasiE.00:32:23.330 --> 00:32:34.390Iain Collis (Guest)And the most benefit to the business. But it's also where the customer sees the most benefit, because our indirect structure is like is is smaller than, you know, uh, Riker or assert EQ. Therefore our costs are less.00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:36.800Donato MasiPerfect.00:32:38.090 --> 00:32:38.790Donato MasiAll right here.00:32:39.610 --> 00:32:46.410Donato MasiPerfect, and that's it. So that was very very very effective. Straight to the point I in the.00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:43.050Iain Collis (Guest)Hey.00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:47.380Iain Collis (Guest)Excuse the questioning was so 'cause it's linked.00:32:49.570 --> 00:32:54.530Donato MasiNo, because you know you had this straight all the all the answers that they wanted all in your mind, so that's great.00:32:55.610 --> 00:32:56.220Iain Collis (Guest)Oh gosh.00:32:55.790 --> 00:33:04.050Donato MasiAnd then now what we will do is map, uh, you know what you have described in a canvas that.00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:22.060Donato MasiUh, it's a representation. You know the business model of the firm? Then we see whether we need to complement it with some, uh, you know small details. And then we can make some exercises so needs to see whether digitalization can support innovation, any in any aspect of this business model.00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:23.500Iain Collis (Guest)It would be nice if it could.00:33:24.130 --> 00:33:38.440Donato MasiPerfect alright, so thank you very much for your time and see Microsoft Teams is great because he has done for me the recorded and the transcripts so I have all the interview transcribed so it saves Me 2 hours of work. That's fantastic.00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:28.110Iain Collis (Guest)No problem.00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:38.130Iain Collis (Guest)Perfect.00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:39.960Iain Collis (Guest)He said, did you starvation?00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:40.460Donato MasiYep.00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:43.260Donato MasiThank you bye bye.00:33:42.290 --> 00:33:44.210Iain Collis (Guest)Take care design.
