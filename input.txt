Donato Masi
So yeah, and the purpose of this call is to map a little bit the business model of metal assembly. So understanding which way the digitalization interventions that we're putting in practice can support a bit more the.
Donato Masi
And let's say the business model as a whole apart from the manufacturing related operations. So we will touch nine different points. So customer segments, customer relationships, channels, revenue streams, activities, resources, partners, cost structure and value proposition. Then I explain one by one what they mean.
Donato Masi
And, well, I ask you questions so around 5-6 minutes per question so we can keep the meeting within one hour as planned. OK, so if we start from the customer segments so we mean the groups of people or companies that were trying to target and sell your product or service. So who are they and in which way they are segmented?
Iain Collis (Guest)
OK.
Iain Collis (Guest)
So we are trying to sell to tier one.
Iain Collis (Guest)
Automotive businesses
Donato Masi
Uh-huh
Iain Collis (Guest)
uh and agrammatic businesses, so we're not. We're not trying to sell to major OEM's, but some of those tier one businesses will be OEMs in their own right.
Donato Masi
OK.
Iain Collis (Guest)
But responsible for.
Iain Collis (Guest)
One part of the vehicle, as opposed to the entire vehicle itself. So for example, someone like Knorr bremse. He's an OEM in the sense that it designs and supplies emission control systems.
Iain Collis (Guest)
And it, but it's not. It's not responsible for how those emission control systems are used within the vehicle.
Iain Collis (Guest)
Does that make sense?
Donato Masi
Yes, it's less.
Iain Collis (Guest)
Yeah, and then you'll get. You'll get other tier ones like someone like Morelli or or. The bit of money that we deal with that.
Iain Collis (Guest)
Although it has an input into the design of the interior of the vehicle, it's really working to the customers requirements.
Iain Collis (Guest)
Just does that make sense?
Donato Masi
Yes.
Iain Collis (Guest)
Yeah.
Donato Masi
How many customers are we talking about?
Iain Collis (Guest)
How many miles does Metalassemblies have now? Uh, about 10.
Donato Masi
Yep.
Donato Masi
Then OK and the.
Donato Masi
I mean in the UK, which percentage roughly does it represent of the whole market?
Iain Collis (Guest)
The customers we supply all the all. The total volume of this.
Donato Masi
Yep.
Donato Masi
The one that you supply, yeah.
Iain Collis (Guest)
I would say there's bits, probably 5%.
Donato Masi
Of the whole market.
Iain Collis (Guest)
Yep.
Donato Masi
OK, and there is there any way in which you would segments these customers? You'd cluster them into groups.
Iain Collis (Guest)
I'm yeah you. We would probably cluster them into people that supply things for the interior of the vehicle.
Iain Collis (Guest)
People that supply things for the powertrain of the vehicle.
Iain Collis (Guest)
People that supply things up for the.
Iain Collis (Guest)
Sort of exterior of the vehicle.
Donato Masi
But fact, can you tell me in terms of volumes?
Donato Masi
Uh, I will. This different segments, which is the importance of these different segments in terms of contribution to turn over.
Iain Collis (Guest)
Yeah, so for us the the things that go inside the vehicle and much more interesting because they tend to have more added value.
Iain Collis (Guest)
And so the powertrain stuff thought we can supply. It tends to have quite a low added value and the exterior is normally beyond our capacity, so it's the interior of the vehicle where we see the most.
Donato Masi
OK.
Iain Collis (Guest)
Opportunity for adding value.
Donato Masi
So raffling percentage.
Iain Collis (Guest)
And in terms of the marketplace, is a whole.
Donato Masi
Now, in terms of your turnover.
Iain Collis (Guest)
OK, it's so so. The interior of the vehicle would represent about.
Iain Collis (Guest)
80%.
Donato Masi
OK.
Iain Collis (Guest)
Currently.
Donato Masi
Perfect.
Donato Masi
And now we can move to the second point. That regards the type of relationship that you have with this customers. So how would you define the relationship that you have is a kind of.
Donato Masi
The, uh, highly integrated, transactional, uh, how would you define it?
Iain Collis (Guest)
I think it depends on the customer and so some of the customers. It's a transactional relationship, so dumb and, and that's because we probably aren't actively chasing work from that particular customer for all sorts of reasons. So where we do supply, say JLR directly? And it's a very much a transactional relationship? We're not trying to win new business directly off of JLR.
Donato Masi
OK.
Donato Masi
Uh-huh
Donato Masi
uh-huh
Donato Masi
uh-huh
Iain Collis (Guest)
4.
Iain Collis (Guest)
Some of our customers so customers like Morelli and Drexel Wire. It's. It's an integrated relationship because of the the volume of business we've got for them.
Iain Collis (Guest)
And then for other customers safe for customers like Valeo, it's somewhere between the two.
Donato Masi
integrated what does it mean? Uh, easy, easy to extend it, for instance, to Co designing the components having shared objectives shared a you know risk, shared risk and shared revenues to which level is it into? Our integrated with these suppliers?
Iain Collis (Guest)
Say, say, say it it's integrated on the on, on the on the automotive basis and what that means is it when it suits the customer.
Iain Collis (Guest)
It's it's integrated, and when it doesn't suit the customer, it isn't. So I'll give you a. I'll give you an example of that from a meeting earlier today. So we are. We were discussing our packaging.
Donato Masi
Yep.
Iain Collis (Guest)
And how we will make sure that reusable packaging transfers backwards and forwards between us. So we we take the packaging. We agree with the customer that we will put 20 parts in a box and we will use a particular size box and we will use particular size pallet and we will only ever put 12 boxes on a pallet and that pallet will have a lid and the labels will look in a certain way and we we all agree that and sign up to it because it's important to us and then that you know we we don't damage the parts however they want to use.
Donato Masi
Yep.
Iain Collis (Guest)
Reuse that packaging, not just the plastic boxes, but they also want to reuse the wooden pallet that it all sits on. So we say to the customer. OK, So what we want then is we want a packing specification that says this is how you will supply us back the packaging. Because if you don't supply the packaging back to us in the same manner, high if it's 20 boxes on a pallet. If you supply 30 bucks in their pocket, there won't be enough pallets in the system for us to supply your back. And the answer I got back was no, we can't do that.
Donato Masi
Uh-huh
Iain Collis (Guest)
And so I said, well, why can't you do that? Or we couldn't get anyone in our business to sign for that? Oh no, no, that would be too much. So I I that that I think beautifully describes how the automotive industry works it at our level.
Donato Masi
OK.
Iain Collis (Guest)
And we at where we sit in the supply chain. So on the one level. In other words, information going into the customer. We're pretty integrated, but on the other level, when you know, it seems the customer we're not integrated at all because the customer just doesn't want to know them.
Donato Masi
Yep.
Donato Masi
Uh-huh
Donato Masi
Yep.
Iain Collis (Guest)
But we will put people like Jackson Meyer. We will support them with design.
Iain Collis (Guest)
They're not metal specialist there passively, so they'll have us in meetings and say how would you do that? How can you do that? Can you help us here? But ultimately their design responsible we're only suggesting.
Donato Masi
OK.
Iain Collis (Guest)
If they, if they choose to take our suggestions, they still have to put their name to it.
Donato Masi
OK, clear.
Donato Masi
Thank you yeah, so regarding the channels that you use to reach out your customers, both existing and new ones, what are they?
Iain Collis (Guest)
How do we find new customers?
Donato Masi
Yep.
Iain Collis (Guest)
It's very much through word of mouth, so we we don't really advertise in any way. We have no marketing strategy per say because we're not looking to win lots of new customers because because of the nature of the relationship between supplier and customer in the automotive industry or business of our sides can only support so many customers.
Donato Masi
Uh-huh
Donato Masi
uh-huh
Donato Masi
OK.
Iain Collis (Guest)
Because our indirect structure only enables us to support so many customers.
Donato Masi
OK, but this is. This is something yes, sorry, go ahead.
Iain Collis (Guest)
So.
Iain Collis (Guest)
So, So what? So what? We are what we tend to do is we, we, we? We sort of look at the, the the vehicles that we manufacturing four and understand when they finish.
Iain Collis (Guest)
And we look to either win that replacement business off of our existing customer.
Donato Masi
Uh-huh
Iain Collis (Guest)
Or we look to work with whoever won that replacement business.
Donato Masi
but the fact is, these are how you want it to continue or for the future you would like to do some market intelligence and this type of things.
Iain Collis (Guest)
And I think that it can't continue that way for the future because.
Iain Collis (Guest)
Because of the state of the automotive history in the UK, there isn't the volume there anymore, so.
Donato Masi
Yep.
Iain Collis (Guest)
The.
Iain Collis (Guest)
Automotive supply yeah we are just at automotive supplier. It's very difficult for us to supply into, although we do supply into Europe and the rest of the world, we only do that as a result of.
Iain Collis (Guest)
Did tier ones that we supply.
Iain Collis (Guest)
Making us do that if we try to just do it in our own right, it would be very, very difficult to do so. We can really only fish.
Iain Collis (Guest)
In the UK pond.
Iain Collis (Guest)
And the UK pond is getting smaller and smaller because the number of vehicles that are built in the UK are getting smaller and smaller. The other issue is that, uh.
Iain Collis (Guest)
From what I can see, the electric vehicle market is going to fragment the market more and more, so whereas Matt maybe now you have some you know.
Donato Masi
Uh-huh
Iain Collis (Guest)
You know, actually we're going to build electric vehicles, but we're going to build them in a different way and lower volumes. Or we're going to go after one particular marketplace. So you get companies like arrival coming on the scene and wanting to bar wanting to build 2000 buses a year, and they're gonna do that in modular factories. And and you know, so.
Iain Collis (Guest)
The old business model no longer works because instead of having one big company to go to, suddenly you get lots of smaller companies that want a different type of structure and a different type of.
Iain Collis (Guest)
Parts applied to them.
Donato Masi
Perfect and the aware of any, let's say channel to reach out customers that is particularly used in the industry or that you are thinking to use in future.
Iain Collis (Guest)
So the way that we do that at the moment is through the the various trade associations that we belong to. So through the SMT or through make UK, and so that's how we we kind of work out, who these new vehicle manufacturers are and those new vehicle makes a two way things are weird, sort of asking the SMT who's.
Donato Masi
Uh-huh
Iain Collis (Guest)
Who's going to do this and this this the customers are also asking the SMT. Who are the suppliers that can support us?
Donato Masi
OK, and uh, is this, uh, able to do the same job internationally, or only in the UK?
Iain Collis (Guest)
I think that's only going to do the job in the UK.
Donato Masi
OK, any idea for the international market?
Iain Collis (Guest)
Yeah, only as we are now where we would support where you get a vehicle that is built globally. So for example in this town cash guy is a global vehicle. If we win the business in the UK then by default we win the business in in in the global marketplace, yeah?
Donato Masi
Uh-huh
Donato Masi
Yep.
Donato Masi
Internationally OK, but to capture demand apart from the one that is UK related, do you think you you will put any mechanism in place or the intended?
Iain Collis (Guest)
I.
Iain Collis (Guest)
I don't think it's a business we would be able to support a significant a significant amount of standalone international business. We don't have it, you know we don't have a a footprint that will allow us to do that. It's it's already extraordinarily difficult to supply.
Iain Collis (Guest)
You know, in the way that we do at the moment just because of the cost of when things go wrong.
Donato Masi
OK, what do you mean?
Iain Collis (Guest)
OK, so again, if I use so at the moment we we supply a part for BMW who via Valley 04 BMW three and four series. So the BMW three and four series is built in Mexico in China and in Germany.
Donato Masi
Yep.
Donato Masi
Yep.
Iain Collis (Guest)
So, so we only one that business because of our links to UK value.
Iain Collis (Guest)
Uh, and although we don't supply that part in the UK at all, we are having to support it in all three of those locations so but we don't have a. We don't have any.
Iain Collis (Guest)
The UM, any employees in any of those locations.
Iain Collis (Guest)
So if something goes wrong, we're completely reliant on agencies to support us, and that's very expensive.
Donato Masi
OK, I understand.
Donato Masi
And OK, I think this is enough regarding channels. Now let's talk a bit about activity. I mean, uh, we should talk about revenue streams, but I assume that all the revenues are transaction based so you don't charge customers with a fee for a specific service, correct? So you don't have a recurring revenues for a specific service.
Iain Collis (Guest)
No, we we yeah, we said we would we we have two revenue streams, three revenue streams. We have a revenue stream from tooling.
Donato Masi
OK.
Donato Masi
OK.
Iain Collis (Guest)
So we win in order to produce a tool to produce parts, we have a revenue stream from pre production parts. So we we run the program but the tooling is introduced yet but the customer wants or support in manufacturing production parts and then we have the revenue stream from the serial production parts.
Donato Masi
Uh-huh
Donato Masi
uh OK.
Iain Collis (Guest)
So yeah, there's no revenue stream for charging customers for our intellectual property or our ability to help them design something.
Donato Masi
OK, so it's all production.
Iain Collis (Guest)
Yep.
Donato Masi
Correct, perfect.
Donato Masi
So let's, uh, make an overview of the key resources that you have to deliver these products. So in terms of the human resources, how many employees are there now in metalassemblies?
Iain Collis (Guest)
Well, how about 120?
Donato Masi
OK, so how many of them are there? Can you split them between line manager, separators? Engineers? How are they organized?
Iain Collis (Guest)
OK, I could do that, but it's off the top of my head so I think operator wise. Yeah, roughly roughly. There's probably around about 60 operators.
Donato Masi
And lastly, we don't have to be precise.
Donato Masi
OK.
Iain Collis (Guest)
Uh, and then if we said, UM.
Iain Collis (Guest)
Indirect staff to support directly support those operators, so we're talking now. Forklift truck drivers. Machine setters that type of thing. I would say another 20 people.
Donato Masi
Uh-huh
Donato Masi
OK.
Iain Collis (Guest)
And then if you then talk about indirect staff to support the operation of the factory. So now I'm thinking quality people, you know quality technicians, engineer toolmakers, that sort of thing that I would say that's probably another 30.
Donato Masi
OK.
Iain Collis (Guest)
Yeah, so that goes to 110 I think.
Donato Masi
Yep.
Iain Collis (Guest)
And then the other twenty people are going to be people like me, the accounts department.
Iain Collis (Guest)
A new product reduction that everything.
Donato Masi
OK, so which type of visa?
Donato Masi
Which which of these human resources are a, let's say, strategic for you? Very, very easy to replace or critical for the processes. Sorry, very difficult to replace or critical for the processes.
Iain Collis (Guest)
Right now, everything.
Donato Masi
Yep.
Iain Collis (Guest)
It's it's very difficult to replace anything but.
Iain Collis (Guest)
Yeah.
Iain Collis (Guest)
I'm trying to see whichever way we look at. I mean the the problem is it because of the way the automotive industry or any manufacturing district you know industries developed and the operators are fantastically important because they're the ones that get to touch every single part. So whereas perhaps you know 20 or 30 years ago, it was bums on seats and it can't be like that anymore because.
Iain Collis (Guest)
The consequences of getting something wrong and so punitive because you know the every every customer will have probably a minimum of £500 charge for one bad part.
Donato Masi
Uh-huh
Iain Collis (Guest)
And say so so.
Donato Masi
uh-huh
Iain Collis (Guest)
Even even at operator level, it's difficult and strategic. Did you get to get the right person in there but but if you had to then put a scale on it.
Donato Masi
I understand.
Iain Collis (Guest)
And the most difficult people and our technicians.
Donato Masi
Yep.
Donato Masi
OK.
Iain Collis (Guest)
So that will be whether that be toolmakers or robot technicians, or you know, or electrical engineers. Those are the most difficult people to to replace.
Donato Masi
How long does it take to train a technician and how long to train operator?
Iain Collis (Guest)
And to properly train an operator if if it's if it's an operator for one process. So you you say to the operator, this is the only process we want you to do, then that would probably take around about 16 weeks to train them properly.
Donato Masi
Uh-huh
Donato Masi
uh-huh
Donato Masi
OK.
Iain Collis (Guest)
If it was operator that we wanted to put across multiple processes, then that would probably take 18 months.
Iain Collis (Guest)
Before they were competent in all those processes.
Donato Masi
Wow.
Donato Masi
So I understand why it's so difficult for them to.
Iain Collis (Guest)
Yeah yeah, yeah.
Iain Collis (Guest)
Uh, where do we do a good job of that is a is a is a whole other conversation, but if if we were honest with ourselves, that's the sort of timescales that you were looking you. You'd be looking at for a a multi skilled competent operator across all the processes that we do.
Donato Masi
Perfect clear what about intellectual resources? Do you have any patent IP or copyright and what you do?
Iain Collis (Guest)
Don't.
Donato Masi
No, OK, so we go down to the physical resources in terms of equipment inventory and buildings. So I there are now 3/4 buildings correct?
Iain Collis (Guest)
Yes.
Donato Masi
And the how many uh machinery Sardar in these four buildings?
Iain Collis (Guest)
70 odd yeah. How about about 70? Yeah, about 70, I'd say.
Donato Masi
Just so again, we don't have to be precise.
Donato Masi
Yep, 70 machines OK. Do you have any?
Donato Masi
In a just a a figure for the overall value of the machines.
Iain Collis (Guest)
I mean, if you're talking replacement value, then probably somewhere in the region of 6 million.
Donato Masi
Yep.
Donato Masi
OK.
Donato Masi
And I wish this split between the different types of machine.
Iain Collis (Guest)
Uhm?
Iain Collis (Guest)
So pressing machines would be the most, so you know somewhere I would. I'm just guessing now, but somewhere in the region of about four million and then the sort of machines machines.
Donato Masi
Yeah.
Donato Masi
OK.
Iain Collis (Guest)
I'm probably actually. I think he baby. I'm probably wildly underestimating it if we're talking replacement value, it's probably closer to 10 million. So if you say pressing machines is probably right about the 6 million mark.
Donato Masi
OK.
Iain Collis (Guest)
Uh, CNC machines is probably about about the 2,000,000 mark and then welding and all the rest of it would be another 2,000,000.
Donato Masi
Perfect.
Donato Masi
So, uh, now we go down to what are the key partnership that you can have in terms of strategic alliances, corporations, joint ventures or strategic buyer supplier relationships? So let's start from the supply. Yes, OK. Is there any relationship with the suppliers that you consider strategic?
Iain Collis (Guest)
Yes, but it it's normally time based.
Iain Collis (Guest)
So it it it because it relates to a particular vehicle in a particular vehicle, gets built for a particular period of time.
Donato Masi
OK.
Iain Collis (Guest)
There are some exceptions to that, but perhaps over time they become less strategic. So for example, logistics partner.
Donato Masi
Yep.
Donato Masi
Uh-huh
Iain Collis (Guest)
Yeah, it's somebody we've been with for nearly 20 years, so we would consider that scitegic, but what's happened over the last two years is many of our customers have gone to an ex works situation, so it becomes less strategic. Not because we've necessarily got a problem with with the supplier, but simply because of the way that we deliver our goods has has changed.
Iain Collis (Guest)
And.
Iain Collis (Guest)
We would, we would say the same thing for.
Iain Collis (Guest)
Or the finishes that we use the painters and platers that we use.
Donato Masi
Uh-huh
Iain Collis (Guest)
But
Iain Collis (Guest)
to.
Iain Collis (Guest)
They're they're only strategic because we've got a good working relationship with them.
Iain Collis (Guest)
But if one of them was to disappear tomorrow.
Iain Collis (Guest)
They wouldn't necessarily be a long term impact in in replacing them with somebody else.
Iain Collis (Guest)
Because there are plenty of supplies like that around.
Donato Masi
OK.
Iain Collis (Guest)
There are some suppliers or couple of supplies that we used to import things from China that would be strategic, because if they were no longer global supporters, there would be significant.
Iain Collis (Guest)
And cost issues, but they would only be strategic for a particular set of parts rather than the business as a whole.
Donato Masi
Uh-huh
Donato Masi
uh-huh
Iain Collis (Guest)
And.
Donato Masi
perfect.
Iain Collis (Guest)
Yeah, but we would consider you know people like Aston University to be a strategic supplier.
Donato Masi
Yep.
Iain Collis (Guest)
And for the business, and, you know, we would consider someone like the SMT to be strategic or make UK to be strategic.
Iain Collis (Guest)
And whether we'd call them a supplier or not.
Donato Masi
Yeah, it would seem more, you know, a kind of collaborators.
Iain Collis (Guest)
Yeah.
Iain Collis (Guest)
Yeah yeah, yeah.
Donato Masi
Collaborators or partners business because you know they're not properly suppliers and.
Iain Collis (Guest)
Yeah.
Donato Masi
Yes OK so made Aston and uh, OK, quite clear picture and do you have any joint venture with some partners, some type of agreements like this?
Iain Collis (Guest)
No.
Donato Masi
Not joint ventures. OK so clear also this point. Now regarding the cost structure, can you tell me roughly which is the cost structure within the business? So much is raw material, so much is a labor and.
Iain Collis (Guest)
Yep, so if we we define raw material as the steel that we put in parts the any bought out item that we put into apart and any subcontract process that is carried out on apart. So on average at the moment around about 61%.
Donato Masi
Yep.
Donato Masi
Uh-huh
Iain Collis (Guest)
Of our selling price is made up by those three elements material. Sorry labor then comes in at around about 11%.
Donato Masi
OK.
Donato Masi
Yep.
Iain Collis (Guest)
So sort of 7273% of what we do. And then finally the distichs costs. He's around about 2 1/2%, so we kind of at 75% then of everything we do is come is taken up with those three things that that. That the.
Donato Masi
OK.
Iain Collis (Guest)
That's changed very succinct, significantly over the last 18 months, so that's as it is now.
Iain Collis (Guest)
Now, uh, but if we were having this conversation 18 months ago, then that would be closer to 60% and the reason for the change is material price increases.
Donato Masi
Uh-huh
Donato Masi
OK.
Iain Collis (Guest)
So if we said just because it's an easy number to do, but if we if we said 12 months ago, 18 months ago that material was 50%. So for every pound we spent £0.50 of it was material material prices doubled.
Donato Masi
OK.
Iain Collis (Guest)
So, but but our selling price hasn't doubled because we are only able to add on the additional cost of the material, and it's very difficult to get an additional margin attacks to that. So now our selling price might be, you know, if it was 50 people or so pounds selling price and it was 50 people for now. The material costs is is a pound, but the selling price is only £1.50. So now the the the margin the material 'cause now it's 75% as opposed to the previous 50%.
Iain Collis (Guest)
And margins reduced to 25% in. Spent £15 in pounds. It's the same. The margin is the same number, but the the percentage wise has been totally skewed because of the big increases in material.
Donato Masi
Clear.
Iain Collis (Guest)
What that means is that.
Donato Masi
OK.
Iain Collis (Guest)
Uh, because our pricing structure has to cope with.
Iain Collis (Guest)
A very long.
Iain Collis (Guest)
Lifetime so you know most vehicles we're quoting six year lifetime.
Iain Collis (Guest)
And it's very difficult for us to go back to the customer and say, oh, hang on a minute because of the change in material pricing. We need to reevaluate everything and come up with a new price. We can do it on new part on new work, but it's very difficult to do it on existing work.
Donato Masi
Mickey, what do you think could be a solution for the volatility of the prices of raw materials? Because it's a problem that regards the whole industry.
Iain Collis (Guest)
Well, I think that that's that's the $64,000 question.
Iain Collis (Guest)
The the I mean the difficulty is is that for the last 10 years?
Iain Collis (Guest)
Material hasn't been volatile.
Iain Collis (Guest)
Uh, if you take out what happened in 2007, eight, which is actually now at 12 years 13 years ago.
Donato Masi
Yeah.
Iain Collis (Guest)
And you can pretty much draw a line of plus or minus 10%.
Iain Collis (Guest)
Uh, of material pricing so it hasn't really been an issue. There have been the odd little spike here and there, but nothing nothing, you, you. It lasts for three months and you're you're through it and off you go.
Iain Collis (Guest)
And.
Iain Collis (Guest)
What's happened now is is a is a shock. It's a seismic shock. It's a step change in the marketplace and it shows no sign of of falling back. So when it when we first saw it happen they were saying well, it'll only last for six months because that's the sort of you know. Historically, that's what would have happened, and then it became well it. It'll start to drop back in in the beginning of 2021 and now everyone saying, well, maybe we'll see some changes in 2023, but we're probably going to see another increase in 2022 because of the gas.
Donato Masi
Uh-huh
Iain Collis (Guest)
Well, energy pricing, yeah, so does the whole game has changed in terms of material?
Donato Masi
Yep, prizes.
Donato Masi
Yep.
Iain Collis (Guest)
And and that's a massive problem for anybody that manufacturers anything, because no one really knows how to pass it on to their customer.
Donato Masi
Do you think that, uh, a solution could be?
Donato Masi
The the having a closed loop supply chain so control over closed loop flows of material in the sense that products are collected at the end of their life cycle and all the materials are reprocessed. Is it feasible or technical? It's too challenging.
Iain Collis (Guest)
Umm, well, I think for steel it's already feasible 'cause it already happens.
Donato Masi
Uh-huh
Iain Collis (Guest)
But but the the the issue with steel is that you can only put so much of it back into the into the new production.
Donato Masi
Yep.
Donato Masi
Uh-huh
Iain Collis (Guest)
Is a challenge same for plastic? You know you you can only recycle plastic so many times and you know before it becomes unusably 'cause it brittles or whatever, whatever, whatever, but. But so I think there's a role for to play in that, but I think what what we're seeing with with companies like JLR, is that what they try and do is they take the responsibility of purchasing away from the supplier.
Donato Masi
Yep.

So they go to a, you know, to A to a steel producer and say we are GLR and we want to buy X 100,000 tons a year.
Iain Collis (Guest)
And then they go to their suppliers and say you will buy from this person here and you know we'll sort out the price and that's the price that will charge you for the whole project. And then any price movement is taken care of between J Lara and the steel supplier.
Donato Masi
OK.
Iain Collis (Guest)
So that's that. And that's not a new thing. 'cause that's been going on for quite some time. The challenge for JLR is how do they get their tier ones to buy into it? So if you're oppressed worker supplying GLR directly, GLR can deal with it. But if you're a tier one, that maybe only has.
Iain Collis (Guest)
Uh, you know 4 metal parts that you buy it. It's very difficult for JLR to get the tier one to buy into that.
Donato Masi
Uh-huh
Iain Collis (Guest)
Because the tier one sees that as part of his value chain and and you know why would he want to fix if steel is 50% of the prize, why would he want they want to fix 50% of the price?
Donato Masi
Yep.
Donato Masi
Yep.
Donato Masi
Clear.
Iain Collis (Guest)
That yeah, that that is. That is the old way of looking at it.
Iain Collis (Guest)
The new way of looking at it is everyone going bloody hell. Look at the price of material we need to fix it. How do we fix it with the customer?
Iain Collis (Guest)
So yeah, there's a. There's a change afoot there. More and more tier ones are looking to try and fix every part of their material price with their customer and take it out of their value chain.
Donato Masi
OK.
Donato Masi
Clear, so some more figures from the balance sheet, which was the be the limit of the last year.
Iain Collis (Guest)
I I I office of my head I don't know I I need to check it. Oh God he bit dark probably about 500,000.
Donato Masi
Roughly.
Donato Masi
And we, we, uh, which percentage is it of the turnover I've been? Or what's the current? What was the turnover?
Iain Collis (Guest)
So it was turned over, would be about 8 and a half million.
Donato Masi
OK, great.
Iain Collis (Guest)
Bear in mind you're asking me about last year, which was COVID.
Donato Masi
Uh.
Iain Collis (Guest)
I mean normally I are EBIT da da, sort of nine million turnover would be about 700 and 5800 thousand.
Donato Masi
So because of car with the let's say it went down to 6.5% normally around 890% something like that, yeah?
Iain Collis (Guest)
Yeah.
Iain Collis (Guest)
Yeah, yeah.
Donato Masi
Perfect.
Donato Masi
So, uh, last thing that we have to discuss, that is, if you want to, the core of the business model is the value proposition. So in the sense of.
Donato Masi
The what do you think that you are offering that is unique with respect to your competitors?
Iain Collis (Guest)
Then
Iain Collis (Guest)
it's a really difficult question, UM?
Donato Masi
So just to make some examples, we could be either thinking of that you are fairly particularly low price or as quick service rather than a unique customer experience or unique design, or a combination of these aspects.
Iain Collis (Guest)
Yeah.
Iain Collis (Guest)
I so I so I think for metalassemblies the the breadth of processes that we can offer is different. You know when you consider the size of the business, it's it's different to other metal processors of our size because we we, you know we can offer turn parts, we can machine things we you know. So we've got a a different range of processes.
Donato Masi
Umm?
Donato Masi
OK.
Donato Masi
Yep.
Donato Masi
Yeah.
Iain Collis (Guest)
And and because we've got a different range of processes, we've got a larger range of technical expertise across those processes. And So what that means is that we we can normally cope with slightly more complex things.
Donato Masi
Yeah.
Donato Masi
M.
Iain Collis (Guest)
4.
Iain Collis (Guest)
A baseball off that you would expect to business of our size to be able to cope with.
Donato Masi
K So if you wanna facture camps with the component that is a bit difficult to manufacture with a particular addition you say OK we can deal with it while other.
Iain Collis (Guest)
Yeah, so I think if you if if we were to take some.
Iain Collis (Guest)
That you sort of conventional way of doing it, which is to sort of put put rings on a piece of paper and look by the overlapped. So if you looked at a company like metal assemblies and let's just say our turnover is 10 million.
Donato Masi
M.
Iain Collis (Guest)
And and then you you, you looked at a business like ricor with a turnover of 100,000,000. And then you looked at a business like, UM Cirtek where the turnover of 250 million.
Iain Collis (Guest)
In a conventional supply chain.
Iain Collis (Guest)
It would be unusual for metalassemblies to be able to compete with either of those two companies at any point in their, you know, in their capacity just simply because of the economies of scale. But what we found with Metalassemblies is that we actually can compete at the fringes of their capacity and the fringes of their capacity. UM, are the sort of extremes of our capacity, but if we can compete in those areas, that's where we see the most adding value.
Donato Masi
Uh-huh
Donato Masi
mm-hmm
Donato Masi
E.
Iain Collis (Guest)
And the most benefit to the business. But it's also where the customer sees the most benefit, because our indirect structure is like is is smaller than, you know, uh, Riker or assert EQ. Therefore our costs are less.
Donato Masi
Perfect.
Donato Masi
All right here.
Donato Masi
Perfect, and that's it. So that was very very very effective. Straight to the point I in the.
Iain Collis (Guest)
Hey.
Iain Collis (Guest)
Excuse the questioning was so 'cause it's linked.
Donato Masi
No, because you know you had this straight all the all the answers that they wanted all in your mind, so that's great.
Iain Collis (Guest)
Oh gosh.
Donato Masi
And then now what we will do is map, uh, you know what you have described in a canvas that.
Donato Masi
Uh, it's a representation. You know the business model of the firm? Then we see whether we need to complement it with some, uh, you know small details. And then we can make some exercises so needs to see whether digitalization can support innovation, any in any aspect of this business model.
Iain Collis (Guest)
It would be nice if it could.
Donato Masi
Perfect alright, so thank you very much for your time and see Microsoft Teams is great because he has done for me the recorded and the transcripts so I have all the interview transcribed so it saves Me 2 hours of work. That's fantastic.
Iain Collis (Guest)
No problem.
Iain Collis (Guest)
Perfect.
Iain Collis (Guest)
He said, did you starvation?
Donato Masi
Yep.
Donato Masi
Thank you bye bye.

Ehsan Eslamian Koupaei
Bye, thank you.
Iain Collis (Guest)
